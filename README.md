# PredictWSJune15
Using Fangraphs plus stats to try and predict WS winner with a Random Forest Model. The data used for the model, its code, and outputs are all in the files. All the data used is from Fangraphs, I used 2010 through 2023 seasons (skipping 2020) to train. The data was from opening day to June 15th for every season. I predicting using data for all games completed through June 14th in the 2024 seasons. Since the games played aren't even for every team in the dataset I used "+ stats" from since they're already normalized. Overall I don't really like the predictions,
